# Drew's Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

## What is this?

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

Because I primarily write Python for my day job, I am writing these in Python
for the sake of getting them done. I make no guarantees that these are the
fastest or best solutions, but they work.

## How do I run them?

Download and install Python 3.14. You'll need to install uv and run `uv sync`.

Save your day's input as `dayXX.txt`, then run `uv run python dayXX.py`.
